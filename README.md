# PasBGFX
Pascal bindings to the C API for [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx), "a cross-platform, graphics API agnostic, Bring Your Own Engine/Framework style rendering library".

Tested and known-working with Free Pascal 3.3.1.

You will need to have the shared library versions of both [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) itself installed in order to run the example programs.
